## RTSFX - Sample Comparison & Evaluation

#### This web page presents the work carried out for the evaluation and improvement of specific RTSFX sounds (recorded vs synthesised sounds). A systematic analysis permitted to individuate similarities and differences amongst different sonic categories. This process informed the definition of the pre-sets subsequently included in the RTSFX user graphical interface.

## New Sound Development

#### New sounds for the RTSFX project were also developed. An original methodology for the development of new sounds was identified. The idea was to consider the RTSFX audio models as basic elements that combined with each other could be used to constitute new and complex audio effects. By adopting this approach, it was possible to assemble new convincing sounds.
